            <h1>About Defying Fire</h1>
            <p>
                Defying Fire is an upcoming DLC sized creation for Starfield in wich you’ll be able to decide the fate of the employees and residents of Yalcin Controlled Space. Will you free the citizens of the control of the Yalcin Corp or do you seek to change The Corporation from within and deal with the ongoing threat of social unrest?

            <h2>What content do we plan on adding in this creation?</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A main Quest</li>
                <li>Side Quests</li>
                <li>A totally new, fully functioning city</li>
                <li>Other Locations</li>
                <li>new player homes</li>
                <li>new companions</li>
                <li>...</li>
            </ul>
            <p><em>(This is our target, any changes to the content are possible and will be communicated clearly.)</em></p>
            <br>
            <h2>When will this creation be available to players?</h2>
            <p>
                We cannot say with certainty when this creation will be ready, right we’re working on the level design of the locations included in this creation. When we have a clearer view of when this creation will be ready we will communicate it.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Can I Join the team?</h2>
            <p>

            <h2>Will this be a free or paid creation?</h2>
            <p>
                This we also can’t say right now, only if we are accepted in the verified creators program AND we feel like the quality is professional and the content is worth its money, we would consider making this a paid creation.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Will this Creation Be achievement friendly?</h2>
            <p>
                We will try our best to be accepted in the verified creators program by Bethesda so we can make this creation achievment friendly, this is a pretty big priority because we know that it is a concern lots of people have when starting to play with mods.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Who are we?</h2>
            <p>
                Right Now the “we” in Firestarter Mods is actually still just “me”. I am a student with a passion for making interesting locations filled with interesting stories. However, for this project to truly live up to its full potential, i could always use some partners to make this a true team.
